# Copy

## Shallow copy

- Copies the objects, but not the elements. It creates/constructs
  a new object, then it inserts references into its objects found in the
  original.
- Is affected by the original. Acts like inheritance.

## Deep copy

- Completely copies the objects and is not affected by changes to the original.
