# OOP - Object Oriented Programming

A class is a blueprint, an object is an instance of a class.
An object has attributes/characteristics and methods/behaviour.

- Abstraction - Used as features for other classes. It is meant to
  be inherited from but not instantiated. Narrowing down the
  essential features that are critical to an object.
- Encapsulation(to hide) - Hiding access to private details of
  and object.
- Polymorphism - The ability to use the same interface for objects
  of different types.
- Inheritance - Extending the capabilities of of a class with
  another class. Single inheritance, multiple inheritance.
