Create a program for Cataloguing Movies.

1. I should be able to create a movie record.
- Each movie should have a title, imdb rating, release year.

2. I should be able to add Movies to MoviesIHaveSeen list.
- When registering movie to the list I want to be able
    to provide my personal rating 0-10.

3. There should be an option to delete last movie
from the MoviesIHaveSeen. OR
- 3.1 if the id of the movie is provided remove a that movie.

4. There should be options to show all created movies list
and MoviesIHaveSeen list.

5. After the program terminates both MoviesIHaveSeen  list
and all created movies should be saved into separate files.

6. At the start of the program the program should read the
files to catch up on what was done before.

Example of testing file operations:
def writetoafile(fname):
    with open(fname, 'w') as fp:
        fp.write('Hello\n')



**Basically do the same but pass the test file a tmpdir fixture,
that does not need to be defined as it is built-in to pytest
